BlockServer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BlockServerProject/BlockServer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BlockServerProject/BlockServer)
===========
BlockServer is an open source platform for Minecraft server software. It is very extensible and open source. This repository contains the core which is needed to run and load the extra modules which allow players to connect to the server.

The BlockServer Project develops modules to support both PC and PE connections. Currently PC is lower priority as our goal is to support PE first.
